Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a powerful language designed for querying Big Data. It’s capable of querying structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it incredibly versatile. KQL assumes a relational data model, with tables and columns and a minimal set of data types, making it expressive and easy to read.

KQL is particularly effective for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs, with deep support for text search and parsing, time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs. This makes KQL an optimal language for data analysis.
